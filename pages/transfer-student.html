          Frustrated by the failing public school system around her, Amara longs for change but feels powerless to create it. 
          At home, she struggles with grief over her father’s death and her mother's abandonment. To make matters worse, for weeks, 
          she has been haunted by nightmares she doesn't understand. Then one morning, she wakes up in the body of a different student 
          in a different country, with a new name, identity, and school awaiting her. Each education system challenges what she thought 
          she knew about opportunity, privilege, and the future—a future she’s beginning to glimpse in terrifying flashes. 
          What Amara does know now is this: the fight for education is bigger than her, and she may be the only one who can change it. 
          But with every answer comes a harder question: What will it cost to make it back home?
