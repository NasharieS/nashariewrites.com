          Frustrated by the failing public school system around her, Amara longs for change but feels powerless to create it. 
          At home, she struggles with grief over her father’s death and her mother's abandonment. To make matters worse, for weeks, 
          she has been haunted by nightmares she doesn't understand. Then one morning, she wakes up in the body of a different student 
          in a different country, with a new name, identity, and school awaiting her. Each education system challenges what she thought 
          she knew about opportunity, privilege, and the future—a future she’s beginning to glimpse in terrifying flashes. 
          What Amara does know now is this: the fight for education is bigger than her, and she may be the only one who can change it. 
          But with every answer comes a harder question: What will it cost to make it back home?

          <em>The Transfer Student</em> was born from a desire to reimagine how we talk about education inequities.
          After traveling internationally and conducting interviews on education systems around the world,
          I realized there needed to be a more creative, accessible way to share what I had learned—especially with
          young students who might see themselves in Amara’s journey. I wanted to capture both the heartbreak and hope
          in these systems through a story that felt real, emotional, and urgent especially at a time when public education and equity efforts are increasingly under pressure.<br><br>
          I am currently in the revision stage of my manuscript and plan to begin querying literary agents this summer.
